## What is a Technology stack?
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software. They are acronymns for individual technologies used together for a specific technology product. some examples are…

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS
## Introduction
A “LAMP” stack is a group of open-source software that is typically installed together to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps. This term is actually an acronym which represents the Linux operating system, with the Apache web server. The site data is stored in a MySQL database, and dynamic content is processed by PHP.

In this guide, I’ll install a LAMP stack on an Ubuntu server running on AWS.

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

## STEP 2 — INSTALLING APACHE AND UPDATING THE FIREWALL

## STEP 3 — INSTALLING MYSQL

## STEP 4 — INSTALLING PHP

## STEP 5 — CREATING A VIRTUAL HOST FOR YOUR WEBSITE USING APACHE

## STEP 6 — ENABLE PHP ON THE WEBSITE
